🚀 Awesome 3D Platformer in Godot 🎮
Welcome to my 3D Platformer project built in Godot Engine! 🌟 This is a passion project I’ve been tinkering with as I learn game development. I’m no pro—just someone having fun, experimenting, and growing as a developer. My goal? To give you a solid starting point to jump into Godot, tweak this project, or even completely demolish it and make it your own! 🛠️ Feel free to rip it apart, rebuild it, or use it as inspiration—it’s all yours to play with! 😎

✨ Features That Make This Game Shine
Here’s what this 3D platformer brings to the table:

⚔️ Simple Attack System: Hack and slash with a straightforward combat setup. Perfect for adding your own flair!
🕹️ Advanced State Machines: Smooth animation handling powered by AnimationPlayer. No AnimationTree here—just pure, flexible control! 🎥
🏃‍♂️ Dodge, Sidestep, & Block: Spice up your gameplay with slick movement mechanics to evade and defend.
🎶 Background Music & Audio: Immersive BG music with proper audio handling to set the mood.
📜 Main Menu & Pause Menu: Fully functional menus with:
Options to quit, resume, or dive into a settings page.
A settings page with audio level controls to crank up or tone down the volume. 🔊


🌈 Built for Fun & Learning: This project is beginner-friendly but packed with enough systems to inspire intermediate devs too!


🛠️ Why This Project?
I’m learning Godot as I go, and this project is my way of sharing what I’ve built so far. It’s not perfect, but it’s a great foundation for anyone wanting to:

Learn Godot’s 3D workflow.
Experiment with state machines and animation.
Build a combat system or menu UI.
Or just tear it apart and make something totally new! 🔥

You have my full permission to take this project, break it, rebuild it, or use it however you want. My only hope is that it sparks some creativity or helps you skip the boring setup stuff. 🚀

📋 How to Get Started

Clone or Download: Grab this project from the repository.

🙌 A Quick Note
This project is a learning journey, just like yours might be. If you’re new to Godot, don’t be afraid to dive in and mess around. If you’re a seasoned dev, I hope you find something useful to build upon. Either way, have fun and make something awesome! 🎉
